# Presentation

This folder contains the final deck for the case study.

**Files**
- `case_study_deck.pdf` — final slides, sized for a 10–15 minute talk.

**Quick links:** [One-page summary](../SUMMARY.md) • [SQL index](../sql/README.md) • [Docs index](../docs/README.md)

**How to use**
- Review the one-pager, then open the PDF.
- Speaker cues align with the deck; longer narrative lives in `docs/NOTES.md`.

**If you update the deck**
- Export to PDF as `case_study_deck.pdf` (print quality).
- Keep slide order and chart labelling consistent with the SQL outputs.
