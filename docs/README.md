# Docs index
Narrative + methodology that support the deck and SQL.

**Quick links:** [One-page project summary](../SUMMARY.md) • [Slides (PDF)](../presentation/case_study_presentation.pdf) • [SQL index](../sql/README.md) • [Notes summary](NOTES.md) • [Full working notes](WORKING_NOTES_FULL.md)

**Read this first (disclaimer)**

`NOTES.md` and `WORKING_NOTES_FULL.md` are exploratory working notes — hypotheses, hunches, and dead-ends. They are **not** causal claims or final conclusions. Treat them as thinking-in-progress; the authoritative summary is in `SUMMARY.md` and the slide deck.

**If you only have 5–10 minutes**
1) Read `SUMMARY.md`
2) Flip through the deck
3) Skim `NOTES.md` → “Phase 1: Core analysis” and “Phase 2.5: Power Six”

**Terminology (cheat sheet)**
- **HRE** = home margin − road margin  
- **Venue effect** ≈ HRE ÷ 2  
- **pp** = percentage points (not %)  

**Data scope**
D-I men, 2014–2017 regular season; no neutrals/tournaments; team-season ≥8H/≥8A.
