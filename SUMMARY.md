## What this is
A short case study on NCAA D-I men’s hoops (2014–2017) asking: what changed about home-court advantage after the 2015–16 rule bundle?

## What I did
Built a clean, reproducible slice (no tournaments/neutral sites), normalized at the team-season level (≥8H/≥8A), then tracked the home–road edge (HRE) and the usual levers (fouls, FT rate, turnovers, rebounds, shooting, pace). I also split results by tier: Power Six / Mid-Majors / Other D-I.

## What I found
- Pace jumped immediately; a small home tempo edge remained.
- HRE fell ~3–4 points by 2016–17 (≈2 venue points softer).
- Win% stayed ~67%, but **margins** tightened (fewer blowouts; close-game share ~flat).
- Classic levers were basically steady; away scoring rose faster than home.
- Tier matters: Power Six ticked up slightly; the decline was outside the Power Six.

## Why it matters
If you model games, trim the default home bump nationally and keep tier splits. For coaches/media, talk less about “the building” and more about matchups and possession quality.

> This is a **nowcast**, not a causal claim: the shifts coincide with the rules window. It’s practical signal you can use while better evidence accrues.
